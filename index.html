  <h2>This is my self-portrait!</h2>
  <p>    To express myself and my culture I have made this website. It shows some of my achievement and pictures, as well as my family tree accompanied by info and pictures of my family members. During which, I have faced many obstacles and challenges, especially those that are caused by the differences between my culture (Saudi culture) and the western culture. In the process of making this self-portrait, I have learnt countless lessons and gained experience in various fields (especially coding).
</p>

	<p>   It all started off when I arrived to the US and made some American friends. While chatting with them, the topic of families and tribes came up. I then noticed that most of the people here in the states lack the curiosity or interest to know their origin and who their great grandparents are, unlike Saudi, where in about every family we have a family tree that shows our origin up to 1000 years back. It shows from what tribe did your family originate from, where are you in the tree, and who are your relatives.</p>

	<p>	  I was so excited and ready to start and finish this project in a day. Turns out, it took way longer than I expected. I started out by learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and Java to get started on coding my site. I used various resources for my learning journey, but the one that benefited me the most is w3schools. They had many tutorials that are explained well, they also had a feature where you can try out the code before implanting it on your site. And as a newbie in programming this was really helpful, and honestly without it I don’t think I could’ve finished my project.
        
        
</p> <p>   After studying and learning the basics of these programming languages, I stumbled upon a new challenge, FAMILY TREES! Due to the massive differences between the Saudi culture and the western, it was extremely hard to figure out how to implement my family tree to my site. And that is because of the following reason: Most family trees in Saudi consist of men only (because when a woman marries a man she doesn’t change her family name, and due to the fact that many men in Saudi marry up to 4 women) unlike family trees in the US, where they have to include both the father and mother; thus, I couldn’t use any family tree programs (they require putting both the father and mother.
</p>

    
    
<p>  To get around this obstacle, I decided to hard code my family tree in HTML’s list format, which took a long time to learn as most tutorials I have found just suggested using a family tree program. Once I filled up my family tree, I have decided to make it interactive by adding some data to the family members; so that whenever I hover my mouse above a name, it displays their age and status. Subsequently, I wanted to make this site more personal. So I hyperlinked a picture to my siblings, where upon getting redirected, you’ll see said an image of said sibling with me.
    
    
<p>   All in all, this project has been fun to work on, and super informative and helpful. I hxave acquired a countless amount of new skills. This project also really opened up my eye to the differences between Saudi And the US (culture-wise). I have also made this project a contribution to H.G. Wells’ idea, to make a permanent encyclopedia. Now whenever someone wants to know the history of Alhussaini’s family (my family’s name) he can enter this site.
